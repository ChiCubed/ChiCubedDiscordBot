# ChiCubedDiscordBot
A discord bot for me to play with.

Put the token in a JSON file named `token.json` in the root directory.
This should have an attribute named 'bottoken', and possibly an attribute
named 'googletoken' and 'googlecx' for the API key and search engine key
respectively for the Google Custom Search API.

{
  "bottoken": "12345",
  "googletoken": "67890",
  "googlecx": "aeiou"
}
